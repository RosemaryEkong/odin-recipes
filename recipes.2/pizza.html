    <h1>PIZZA</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="">

    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <P>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. </P>

    <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>STEPS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with a medium bowl that's been lightly coated with olive oil. Add warm water (about 110 degrees F), dry yeast and sugar. Note: The activated yeast feeds on the sugar and makes the dough rise. In another bowl, combine flour and salt. Have a fork, cutting board, knife, pizza pan and rolling pin (optional) handy.</li>
        <li>Make a Well in the Center of the Dough</li>
        <li>Knead the Dough</li>
        <li>Cover the Dough in Plastic Wrap</li>
        <li>Check to See If the Dough Is Done</li>
        <li>Divide the Dough</li>
        <li>Shape the Dough</li>
        <li>Top the Pizza and Bake</li>
    </ol>
